# Tweetero

## Description

Tweetero is a TypeScript-based backend application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It stores data in memory and serves as a simple tweet management system. This system is basically a copy of twitter.


**Content:** I have utilized TypeScript and OOP principles to create an efficient backend solution. Explore the code to see how these concepts are implemented.

**Technical Skills and Tools:** This project demonstrates proficiency in TypeScript and showcases the usage of npm for managing dependencies.
